I was intially introduced to Software Engineering from the guys (Timur, Artur, & Ruben) on the "Career Karma" app. I was in the process of registering to go back to school for IT/Cybersecurity and while scrolling through Instagram, I came across Career Karma. I have always had an interest in technology and electronics from when I was an Electronics/Wireless Supervisor at Walmart. My current degree that I have is a B.S. in Biology/Chemistry and although I am utilizing my degree as a Medical Laboratory Supervisor, I would like to bring the two career fields (laboratory science and technology) together. After speaking with Timur from Career Karma, he gave me resources to contact Flatiron. Once I spoke with the representive from Flatiron and read multiple success stories from students with various career backgrounds, I knew studying Software Engineering was the right route I should explore. And to top it all off, I could study Software Engineering with little to no cost obtaining the same skill sets and knowledge from Flatiron and ultimately obtain a high paying job doing what I've had a passion to do. I believe becoming a Software Engineer will open up many doors as I try to bridge the two career interests. I am ready to start my journey and finish the race.
