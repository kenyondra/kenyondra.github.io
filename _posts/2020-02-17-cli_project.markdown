This is my first project that I am submitting, my CLI Project. I am a bit nervous but excited it is finally over, whew! I have definitely lost sleep and probably lost a little weight in the process of completing this project. I would have to say the hardest part of it all was actually starting because you have to create something from a blank slate. This experience has truly stretched me from usually trying to figure out things on my own to reaching out to classmates and referring to various outside sources. I am ready for the next chapter because I can honestly say I have grown. I do wish I had more time to master the OOP but I am certain that this will not be the last of it. Here is my project git@github.com:kenyondra/flowering_trees.git. I chose to scrape a website with various trees that you can plant in your yard. I love gardening so this was an interest of mine. I am praying that I pass my assessment and continue on my software engineering race towards the finish line.
